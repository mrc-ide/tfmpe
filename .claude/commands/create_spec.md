# Create Spec Command

Create a new feature specification following the complete spec-driven workflow.

## Usage
```
/create_spec <feature-name> [description]
```

## Workflow Philosophy

You are an AI assistant that specializes in spec-driven development. Your role is to guide users through a systematic approach to feature development that ensures quality, maintainability, and completeness.

### Core Principles
- **Structured Development**: Follow the sequential phases without skipping steps
- **User Approval Required**: Each phase must be explicitly approved before proceeding
- **Atomic Implementation**: Execute one task at a time during implementation
- **Requirement Traceability**: All tasks must reference specific requirements
- **Test-Driven Focus**: Prioritize testing and validation throughout

## Complete Workflow Sequence

**CRITICAL**: Follow this exact sequence - do NOT skip steps:

1. **Requirements Phase** (Phase 1)
   - Create requirements.md using template
   - Get user approval
   - Proceed to design phase

2. **Design Phase** (Phase 2)
   - Create design.md using template
   - Get user approval
   - Proceed to tasks phase

3. **Tasks Phase** (Phase 3)
   - Create tasks.md using template
   - Get user approval

4. **Implementation Phase** (Phase 4)
   - execute tasks individually

## Instructions

You are helping create a new feature specification through the complete workflow. Follow these phases sequentially:

**WORKFLOW SEQUENCE**: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Generate Commands
**DO NOT** run task command generation until all phases are complete and approved.

### Initial Setup

1. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Create `.claude/specs/{feature-name}/` directory
   - Initialize empty requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md files

2. **Load Context Documents**
   - Look for .claude/steering/package.md (package vision and goals)
   - Look for .claude/steering/tech.md (technical standards and patterns)
   - Look for .claude/steering/structure.md (project structure conventions)
   - Load available steering documents to guide the entire workflow

3. **Analyze Existing Codebase** (BEFORE starting any phase)
   - **Search for similar features**: Look for existing patterns relevant to the new feature
   - **Identify reusable components**: Find utilities, services, hooks, or modules that can be leveraged
   - **Review architecture patterns**: Understand current project structure, naming conventions, and design patterns
   - **Cross-reference with steering documents**: Ensure findings align with documented standards
   - **Find integration points**: Locate where new feature will connect with existing systems
   - **Document findings**: Note what can be reused vs. what needs to be built from scratch

## PHASE 1: Requirements Creation

**Template to Follow**: Use the exact structure from `.claude/templates/requirements-template.md`

### Requirements Process

1. **Generate Requirements Document**
   - Use the requirements template structure precisely
   - **Align with package.md**: Ensure requirements support the package vision and goals
   - Consider edge cases and technical constraints
   - **Reference steering documents**: Note how requirements align with package vision

## PHASE 2: Design Creation

**Template to Follow**: Use the exact structure from `.claude/templates/design-template.md`

### Design Process

1. **Load Previous Phase**

   - Ensure requirements.md exists and is approved
   - Load requirements document for context

2. **Codebase Research** (MANDATORY)

   - **Map existing patterns**: Identify data models, API patterns, component structures
   - **Cross-reference with tech.md**: Ensure patterns align with documented technical standards
   - **Catalog reusable utilities**: Find validation functions, helpers, middleware, hooks
   - **Document architectural decisions**: Note existing tech stack, state management, routing patterns
   - **Verify against structure.md**: Ensure file organization follows project conventions
   - **Identify integration points**: Map how new feature connects to existing auth, database, APIs

3. **Create Design Document**

   - Use the design template structure precisely
   - **Build on existing patterns** rather than creating new ones
   - **Follow tech.md standards**: Ensure design adheres to documented technical guidelines
   - **Respect structure.md conventions**: Organize components according to project structure
   - **Include Mermaid diagrams** for visual representation
   - **Define clear interfaces** that integrate with existing systems

## PHASE 3: Tasks Creation

**Template to Follow**: Use the exact structure from `.claude/templates/tasks-template.md`

### Task Planning Process
1. **Load Previous Phases**
   - Ensure design.md exists and is approved
   - Load both requirements.md and design.md for complete context

2. **Generate Atomic Task List**
   - Break design into atomic, executable coding tasks following these criteria:
   
   **Atomic Task Requirements**:
   - **File Scope**: Each task touches 1-3 related files maximum
   - **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes by an experienced developer
   - **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
   - **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
   - **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching
   
   **Task Granularity Examples**:
   - BAD: "Implement authentication system"
   - GOOD: "Create User model in models/user.py with email/password fields"
   - BAD: "Add user management features" 
   - GOOD: "Add password hashing utility in utils/auth.py using bcrypt"
   
   **Implementation Guidelines**:
   - **Follow structure.md**: Ensure tasks respect project file organization
   - **Prioritize extending/adapting existing code** over building from scratch
   - Use checkbox format with numbered hierarchy
   - Each task should reference specific requirements AND existing code to leverage
   - Focus ONLY on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
   - Break large concepts into file-level operations

## Workflow Rules

## Universal Rules

- Only create ONE spec at a time
- Always use snake_case for feature names
- Follow exact template structures in the specified template files
- Do not proceed without explicit user approval between phases
- Do not skip phases - complete Requirements → Design → Tasks

## Error Handling

If issues arise during the workflow:
- **Requirements unclear**: Ask targeted questions to clarify
- **Design too complex**: Suggest breaking into smaller components  
- **Tasks too broad**: Break into smaller, more atomic tasks
- **Implementation blocked**: Document the blocker and suggest alternatives
- **Template not found**: Inform user that templates should be generated during setup

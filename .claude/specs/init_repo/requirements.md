# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the foundational infrastructure for the TFMPE (Tokenised Flow Matching for Posterior Estimation) repository. It provides all necessary project setup components including package structure, development tools, testing infrastructure, and automation to enable efficient development of the scientific computing package.

## Alignment with Package Vision

This feature directly supports all goals outlined in package.md by:

- **TFMPE Implementation**: Creates the modular package structure (estimators/, nn/) needed for future tokenised estimator development
- **Data-preprocessing**: Establishes preprocessing/ module directory for future structured parameter flattening implementations
- **Bottom-up sampling**: Provides sampling/ module directory for future efficient TFMPE training algorithm implementations
- **Performance Goals**: Implements pytest with speed/scale benchmarking infrastructure to enable future sampling efficiency validation
- **Scientific User Focus**: Sets up clear documentation structure and testing framework to support scientists implementing experiments

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project configuration files, so that I can install dependencies, run tests, and maintain code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `pip install -e .` THEN the package SHALL install with core dependencies from pyproject.toml
2. WHEN I run `pip install -e .[dev]` THEN the system SHALL install development dependencies
3. WHEN I run `pip install -e .[examples]` THEN the system SHALL install example/plotting dependencies
4. WHEN I run `pyright` THEN the system SHALL perform type checking without configuration issues
5. WHEN I examine pyproject.toml THEN it SHALL separate dependencies into default (jax, flax, optax), dev (pytest, pyright, jaxtyping), and examples (matplotlib, seaborn, hydra) bands
6. WHEN I check project metadata THEN it SHALL specify Python >=3.10 and TFMPE package description

### Requirement 2: Package Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly organized package structure, so that I can implement features following established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the tfmpe/ directory THEN it SHALL contain empty directories: metrics/, estimators/, bijectors/, preprocessing/, sampling/, nn/ matching structure.md
2. WHEN I check nn/ subdirectory THEN it SHALL contain an empty transformer/ subdirectory prepared for future implementations
3. WHEN I import tfmpe THEN the system SHALL import successfully through __init__.py
4. WHEN I examine each module directory THEN it SHALL contain __init__.py files for proper Python package structure
5. WHEN I review directory structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain any implementation code, only structural placeholders

### Requirement 3: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure, so that I can validate future code correctness and performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `python -m pytest test/` THEN the system SHALL execute successfully with no tests (empty test suite)
2. WHEN I check pytest configuration THEN it SHALL support "slow", "speed", and "scale" test markers as defined in structure.md
3. WHEN I examine test/ directory THEN it SHALL mirror tfmpe/ structure with empty test directories
4. WHEN I review conftest.py THEN it SHALL provide placeholder fixtures for future scientific computing tests
5. WHEN I check pyproject.toml THEN it SHALL include pytest-benchmark dependency for future performance validation

### Requirement 4: Code Quality Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality tools, so that I can maintain high code standards and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `pyright` THEN the system SHALL perform static type analysis with zero errors on empty package structure
2. WHEN I check dev dependencies THEN they SHALL include jaxtyping for future JAX Array type annotations
3. WHEN I examine import patterns in __init__.py files THEN they SHALL follow structure.md ordering conventions
4. WHEN I review package structure THEN it SHALL be ready for type-annotated function implementations

### Requirement 5: Documentation Setup

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear documentation structure, so that future implementations can be properly documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read README.md THEN it SHALL explain TFMPE purpose, installation instructions, and development setup
2. WHEN I check NEWS.md THEN it SHALL provide changelog structure for future version history
3. WHEN I examine mkdocs.yml THEN it SHALL configure documentation generation with placeholder content
4. WHEN I review docs/ structure THEN it SHALL be prepared for API documentation and examples

### Requirement 6: Continuous Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipeline, so that tests and quality checks run automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I push code THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically run tests, type checking, and documentation builds
2. WHEN I create a pull request THEN the system SHALL validate all quality checks pass
3. WHEN I check CI configuration THEN it SHALL test against Python 3.10+ versions
4. WHEN documentation builds THEN the system SHALL generate docs successfully with mkdocs
5. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL test installation of all dependency groups (default, dev, examples)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Package structure setup must complete in under 5 seconds
- CI pipeline should complete basic checks in under 5 minutes

### Usability
- Clear installation instructions for different dependency groups
- Intuitive empty package structure following scientific Python conventions

### Maintainability
- Modular structure allowing independent future development of components
- Clear separation between legacy (sfmpe_legacy/) and new implementation structure
- Empty package ready for implementation following established patterns
